Comments:
We believe our code is working as it should to solve the problem both concurrently and distributively. When we first tested this it worked perfectly. However later on we had experienced some networking difficulties. We have attached a video showing our working solution in the case that the program does not work for the TA. The problem had occurred when testing the distributive version. The error messages showed by the terminal said "message lost" and we are not sure why this was the case.  Thanks.
